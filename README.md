# Traffic Control System

This project is a one-way traffic controller using logic gates. The basic idea behind the design is to avoid the collision of vehicles by providing appropriate signals to different directions for a limited time slot, after which the next waiting drivers will be given same treatment. In this way a cycle will be established which will control the traffic.
